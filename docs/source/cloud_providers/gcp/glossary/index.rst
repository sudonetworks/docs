GCP Terms
=========

GCP, like other major cloud providers, has its own glossary because cloud computing involves a vast array of specialized terms.  These terms can be confusing or ambiguous to those unfamiliar with cloud concepts. A dedicated glossary helps users:

-  **Understand Documentation:** GCP documentation uses specific terminology.  A glossary ensures readers can quickly find definitions.
-  **Communicate Effectively:** A glossary provides a common vocabulary for developers, administrators, and users working with GCP.
-  **Reduce Ambiguity:** Many terms have specific meanings in the context of cloud computing.  A glossary clarifies these meanings.
- **Onboard New Users:** A glossary is helpful for those new to GCP.

Using Glossary Terms
--------------------

You can refer to terms defined in the glossary using the :term:`role`.
For example, we can refer to :term:`Sphinx`, :term:`reStructuredText (RST)`,
:term:`Documentation`, and :term:`API`.

You can also use a different text to refer to the term, like this:
:term:`RST <reStructuredText (RST)>`.

Another example :term:`Term 1` and :term:`Term 2`.
