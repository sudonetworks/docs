Welcome to My Notes!
====================

👋 Welcome, traveler of the terminal and tamer of tech docs.

This is my personal knowledge base — a living, version-controlled brain-dump of commands, configs, code snippets, and “how did I fix that last time?” wisdom. Built with `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and powered by caffeine, it’s here to help me (and maybe you) debug life a little faster.

What you'll find here:

- 🧠 **Structured Thinking** – Organized notes, not chaos (mostly)  
- 🔧 **Tech Tips & Tricks** – From shell sorcery to Python puzzles  
- 📚 **Guides & Cheatsheets** – Because RTFM is better when it's *your* FM  
- 🚧 **Work in Progress** – This doc is never finished, only deployed  

.. tip::

   Use the sidebar or the search bar above to Ctrl+F your way through my brain.

This isn't a blog. It's not a tutorial site. It's a devlog, a digital garden, a command-line companion. Take what you need, fork what you want, and may your stack traces be short.

Enjoy,
SudoNet
